General notes:

• Image of Vaas (main charater) created by Ubisoft themselves so I assume they would let me use it comercially (the only editing I did was cut the face out of a background using the pen tool).

NB: 

Given the target market (users with a PC powerful enough to play Far Cry 3) I focused my design toward users with a screen of 1080p resolution or larger and scaled down for mobile from that design (rather than the norm of vice-versa). 

I have chosen to disable the video on mobiles as mobile cap in NZ is very expensive and I doubt most would watch the video. Instead I have just kept the essentials.
